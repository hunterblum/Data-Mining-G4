Project Title: Stroke Risk Prediction

Objective: The main purpose of this project is to develop a classification machine learning model to predict stroke risk.  This is done using a data set consisting of 11 predictor variables the cover both lifestyle, age, and overall health.  Our project focused on constructing a sensitive and accurate model to identify what patients are most likely to have a stroke to capitalize on the success of early prevention techniques.  The data was collected from Kaggle.com and consisted of 12 attributes describing traditional stroke risk factors.

Project Description:
Caused by vascular injuries in the brain, strokes are the second leading cause of death and disability in the world. In the United States, somebody dies of a stroke every 3.5 minutes resulting in $53 billion in costs annually. However, prevention strategies can have a massive impact, with current prevention techniques mitigating up to 80% of strokes. A major part of beginning prevention is identifying patients who are at risk of stroke. Current model accuracies for predicting strokes in patients can range from 88% to 97%. This project considers existing data based on patient risk factors, identifies the key predictor variables, and evaluates model efficacy. The goal is to identify which modeling algorithm, provides the most accurate and sensitive predictions of strokes in patients when a testinged with novel data. 

The data set is in .csv format, and can be found on kaggle.com at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset.

3) age: age of the patient
4) hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension
5) heart_disease: 0 if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease
